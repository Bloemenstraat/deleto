Deleto is a Chrome extension tool that helps you delete browser history depending on pre-defined keywords.  
**For example**: if you add the keyword "Manga" and you click on the icon button available in the top-right of the browser, all links in the history that include the word manga in the link will be deleted.

The extension includes a variety of other features designed to help you customize the tool as you wish.

## Features:

- Delete full history
- Close opened tab that includes keywords
- Save your settings with a password
- **And much more...**
